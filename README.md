## Objective

- Configure an Express.js back end to serve static HTML files.
- Configure an Express.js back end to create an API to handle GET and POST requests.
- Parse parameters in server-side routes.

- Implement separation of concerns for routing.
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Deploy a server-side application to the Heroku platform.

## Languages

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- Node
- Express

## Technologies

- GitLab: To clone the repository
- GitHub: To create a new repository
- Git (MacOS Terminal): To pull and push the repository
- Visual Studio Code: To write and edit HTML and CSS
- Heroku

## Technologies

Run the following command to install dependencies (CRUD method was used in the server.js file):
npm install express npm i uuid

## Process

1. Created a repo in Github.

2. Added and reviewed the supplied frontend files.

3. Used Express.js to create a Node.js web server.

4. Created server.js and Set up GET routes to serve selective JSON data based on parameters.

5. Updated your server to serve client-side code.

6. Used the Fetch API to make requests to the server.

7. Modularized and scaled the API using the Express.js Router.

8. I ensured everything worked without bugs with Jest.

9. I merged branches in Github.

10. I pushed my completed challenge to my GitHub repository using Git.

11. Deployed on Heroku and connected to Github.
